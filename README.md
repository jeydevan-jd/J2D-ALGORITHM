# J2D-ALGORITHM

When we enter into the world of machine learning particularly when it comes to facial emotion recognition and object detection
the biggest problem that we face is the "DIFFERENCE".for instance different people have different facial emotion and detecting 
them with high accuracy is a difficult thing.

# THE-SOLUTION
After a lot of researches i've made an algorithm to solve this problem which is specially made for humanoid which uses facial
recognition.

# WORKING-PROCESS
(IN  THE BELOW CASE I TOOK HUMANOID TO EXPLAIN THIS ALGORITHM WHICH RUN'S ON THE BASIS OF A RASPBERRY PI)
(IN THE CASE OF EMOTION DETECTION)
