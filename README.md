# J2D-ALGORITHM

When we enter into the world of machine learning particularly when it comes to facial emotion recognition and object detection
the biggest problem that we face is the "DIFFERENCE".for instance different people have different facial emotion and detecting 
them with high accuracy is a difficult thing.

# THE-SOLUTION
After a lot of researches i've made an algorithm to solve this problem which is specially made for humanoid which uses facial
emotion recognition.

# WORKING-PROCESS
(IN  THE BELOW CASE I TOOK HUMANOID TO EXPLAIN THIS ALGORITHM WHICH RUN'S ON THE BASIS OF A RASPBERRY PI)
(IN THE CASE OF EMOTION DETECTION)

Visit the link for structural diagram of j2d algorithm: https://bit.ly/2sgr8D4

on the boot of the rpi some scripts like receive.py && upload.py and camera will start to run automatically 
camera will start to record all of it's surrounding from it's boot.


##codes will be uploaded asap:)
